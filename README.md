**REST**
REpresentational State Transfer
"I'm talking to you in English, but how am I talking to you"
REST -> communicating through web, internet

**API**
Application Programming Interface

APIs allow program commuincation
in general its a 1 way thing.
The client requests from the server
Client consumes info from server
JSON (Java Script Object Notation) Standard for APIs
    - associative array / dictionary 
    - language of communication
XML is outdated for this
endpoints: where resquests are being made


Rest APIs is a way for other programs/apps to query, update, delete, etc, information. In other words, deal with data in a structured format.

APIs have end points that are kinda like commands/requests
    - endpoints returns response based on request given
    - 404 would be a response if not found

**SETTING UP**
- Installed python
Pip installed with python when installed thorugh Homebrew
- Created requirements.txt file
- Ran 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt' in order to install all those modules in python environment
- I was having issues with flask not being installed in the correct PATH, but i just changed the python interpreter to be the same as the pip version
